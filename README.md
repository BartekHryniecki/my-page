# MY PERSONAL CV WEBSITE
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
As a final project for CS50 course I created my personal CV website. I poured a lot of hard work and dedication into this website, which showcases my proficiency in three essential programming languages: HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. My goal was to create a personal website that would serve as an online portfolio and CV for myself, something that I could use in the real world to demonstrate my programming skills and professional experience. 
The website is visually stunning and features a range of design elements that I'm proud of. From the sleek, modern layout to the carefully chosen color schemes and typography, I've put a lot of thought and effort into making this website visually appealing and user-friendly. I wanted the site to be both functional and aesthetically pleasing, so I've made use of a range of visual effects and interactive elements to create an engaging user experience. One of the highlights of the website is its use of JavaScript to create dynamic and engaging features. I've used JavaScript to create interactive menus, scrolling effects, and other dynamic elements that enhance the user experience and make the website more engaging and interactive.
In addition to its visual appeal, the website is also highly functional and user-friendly. I've made sure that the site is easy to navigate, with clear links and menus that make it easy to find the information you need. I've also included plenty of information about my professional experience and skills, as well as links to my social media profiles, my endeavors and other relevant resources.
It basically consist of 4 sections: “About” section which describes who I am, “Skills” section which lists my technological and financial skills, “Projects” section which serves as a proof of my skills listing all of my past and current endeavors and the “Contact section which can be used to contact me via form on the website that is directly connected with my email by using GmailJS plug.
I'm extremely proud of the website I've created for my final project. It represents a significant achievement for me, both in terms of my programming skills and my ability to create a professional, high-quality website that can be used as a real-world tool for showcasing my skills and experience. I'm excited to continue building on this project and using it as a foundation for future web development work.
